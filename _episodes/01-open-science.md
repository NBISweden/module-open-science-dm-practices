# Reasons for Open Science

By Open Science we mean the movement to make scientific research and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society. Principles of open science are:

* Open methodology
* **Open source**
* **Open data**
* Open access
* Open peer review
* Open educational resources

Of these, Open data and Open source are some of the main drivers for good Data Management practices.

When surveyed, the research community to a large extent seem to agree to that there is a reproducibility crisis. Many studies have been done on Reproducibility of published research, and regardless of scientific domain, it seems that more or less half of the publications looked at are not possible to reproduce. A large part of those are because the underlying data is not available or not understandable. Often it is also not possible to understand how the analyses were done.

To illustrate some issues around research data, let us look at this short movie:
