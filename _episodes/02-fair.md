FAIR (20 min)
To try to guide the scientific community on how to ensure that the research data is useful for others in the digital age, the FAIR principles were published in 2016.

“To be useful for others data should be FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
… for both Machines and Humans”

So what this mean? A brief condensed summary:

Findable
Data have a globally unique persistent identifier

e.g. a DOI, database accession number, etc

Data are described by metadata

Information that explains the data

Data and metadata are findable in a search resource

There must be ways of searching for the data

Accessible
Data is retrievable through a standardised communication protocol (open, free, allowing authentication & authorisation where necessary)

e.g. http, sftp, etc

Metadata are accessible, even if data is no longer available

Information about the data can be found even if data is no longer available

Interoperable
Metadata use a formal, accessible, shared language for knowledge representation

…

Metadata use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles

Standardised ways of capturing information about the data

Metadata include qualified references to other metadata

…

Reusable
Data have a clear data usage license

It is obvious under what conditions the data can be reused

Metadata are associated with detailed provenance

The metadata is detailed enough to understand for what research questions it is relevant to reuse

Metadata meet domain-relevant community standards

Metadata is described according to existing standards in the research field

This is quite a mouthful, and a different angle on what is considered to be part of the scientific process for most researchers. So what is a poor researcher to do?

Which is easier, use practices that supports the FAIR principles from the start of a project (“FAIR at source“), or after it is done, when someone asks for it, retroactively?

The first thing is to start thinking about, and planning for, what practices I can apply in my research to make this easier. And that is what the rest of this course is about.

Data Management Plans, to do your thinking ahead of time

Using standard metadata descriptions, to clearly define your data

Organising your analysis, so you and others can understand what you have done

Use versioning control to keep track of changes you do

Clean up metadata and data to be consistent with the standards you have chosen

Submit your data to international public repositories, so others can find and reuse your data

Use scripted analysis of your data, that can be understood by others
